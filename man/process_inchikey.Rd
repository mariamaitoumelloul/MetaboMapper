\usage{
process_inchikey(df, col_name, N_skeleton = 14, N_inchikey = 23)
}
\arguments{
\item{df}{A data frame containing the column with InChIKey strings.}

\item{col_name}{The name of the column containing the InChIKey strings to be processed.}

\item{N_skeleton}{An integer specifying the number of characters to extract for the skeleton InChIKey.
Default is 14.}

\item{N_inchikey}{An integer specifying the number of characters to extract for the processed InChIKey.
Default is 23.}
}
\value{
A data frame with two new columns:
  - `inchikey_skeleton`: A new column containing the first `N_skeleton` characters of the specified InChIKey.
  - `inchikey_processed`: A new column containing the first `N_inchikey` characters of the specified InChIKey.
}
\description{
Processes a specified column containing InChIKey strings by extracting
    the first `N_skeleton` characters to create a skeleton InChIKey and the first `N_inchikey` characters
    to create a processed InChIKey.
}
\details{
- This function takes a column with InChIKey strings and extracts a skeleton version (first 14 characters)
  and a processed version (first 23 characters) of each InChIKey.
- It returns the data frame with these new columns added.
