\description{
Cleans and standardizes labels by removing spaces, dashes, uppercase letters,
    special characters (such as single and double quotes, asterisks), and numbers in parentheses at the end of the label.
}
\details{
- The function performs several text cleaning operations:
  - It removes spaces and dashes.
  - It converts the text to lowercase.
  - It removes single and double quotes, and asterisks.
  - It uses an external function `remove_letters_between_parentheses` to remove shorter names within parentheses.
  - It also removes numeric values in parentheses at the end of the label (e.g., "(1)", "(2)").
- The cleaned labels are stored in a new column `label_processed`.
